I am currently a postdoc at the [Melady Lab](https://melady.usc.edu/) with Dr. Yan Liu. I am also a research member at the [Hung Robotics Lab](https://hungroboticslab.com/) directed by Dr. Andrew Hung. I graduated from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2022. I was a research assistant at the [Intelligent Systems Lab](https://sites.ecse.rpi.edu/~cvrl/) with Dr. Qiang Ji. I was selected as a research scholar for the [RPI-IBM AIRC program](https://airc.rpi.edu/) and worked closely with Dr. Tian Gao and Dr. Kartik Talamadupula.  

My research interests are in Human-centered AI for Science. I am interested in probabilistic graphical models, Bayesian methods, and physics-informed deep learning. 

I am actively looking for acadamic jobs.
