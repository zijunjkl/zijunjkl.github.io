I am currently a postdoc at the [Melady Lab](https://melady.usc.edu/) at the University of Southern California with Dr. Yan Liu. I graduated from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2022. I was a research assistant at the [Intelligent Systems Lab](https://sites.ecse.rpi.edu/~cvrl/) with Dr. Qiang Ji. I was selected as a research scholar for the [RPI-IBM AIRC program](https://airc.rpi.edu/) and worked at [IBM Waston Lab](https://research.ibm.com/labs/yorktown-heights) during my PhD study.
